		<h2 id="question-1">1. What is royalty-free music?</h2>
		<p>
			Royalty-free music is a modern term representing a simple music licensing model. In general, royalty free means that after paying an initial, one-time fee, you get the right to <strong>use the music as many times as you wish, in as many of your productions as you need, for as long as you want</strong>, in almost any type of audio/visual production. You DON'T have to pay any further royalties, and there is NO periodical, per-use or per-project fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a number of royalty-free licenses. Some of them may include more rights and cover more use-cases than others. However, all of them usually follow the basic principles described above (<strong>a one-time fee</strong>, the ability to use the track as much as you like).
		</p>
	
	
	
		<h2 id="question-2">2. How can I use your music? What’s covered?</h2>
		<p>
			You can use our music in almost any type of audio/visual production, including video/film productions, websites, multimedia, commercials and other advertising, television, radio, broadcasting, podcasts, trade shows/presentations, flash animations, slide shows, games, software, theatrical releases, telephone on-hold messages, audio books and many other commercial and non-commercial productions.
		</p>
		<p>
			We offer simple music usages that cover all of the uses described above and which differ in scope, say by the number of copies that can be distributed, the broadcast level (national or worldwide), etc.
		</p>
		
	
	
	
		<h2 id="question-3">3. Are there restrictions on using the music?</h2>
		<p>
			Though our usages cover a lot of use cases, there are some restrictions:
		</p>
		<p><strong>You may not:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sell, trade in, give away or distribute <strong>the music itself</strong>.</li>
			<li>Use/include the tracks in music compilations, like music compilation CDs/DVDs, where the tracks are stand-alone elements.</li>
			<li>Create/produce new musical works (musical compositions, songs) based on our music. For example, if you are a signer, you may not sing over the music and sell or distribute the song.</li>
		</ul>

		
	
	
	
		<h2 id="question-4">4. Can I download free demos to try in my productions before buying?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Yes</strong>. We understand that to create something, you need to see and understand whether all the elements fit into your creative vision. You can download absolutely FREE demos of every single track on our website.
		</p>
		<p>
			The free demos are lower quality versions of the audio files you get after purchasing. You can try the demos in your project and, if the tracks are what you’re looking for, you can just update them with the full-quality audio files.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can download a demo by clicking the <span class="special-char">&#xE820;</span> icon that is located to the right of the track title/name. <strong>Please note</strong>: These demos are for demo/evaluation purposes only (to try it, to show your clients, etc.) and cannot be used in any real productions.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		<h2 id="question-5">5. Will I get a music document once I purchase a track?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Absolutely</strong>. We know how important it is to be safe when you’re using copyrighted material. Third-parties releasing or distributing your productions may want to verify that you have a valid music document and that you have been authorized to use the music.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, you get a <strong>real, official, music document</strong> (a PDF certificate) that confirms your right to use the track in accordance with the usage.
		</p>		
		
		
		
		
		<h2 id="question-6">6. What formats are the master audio files delivered in?</h2>
		<p>
			All audio files are provided in WAV (44,000 Hz, 16-bit, Stereo) and MP3 (44,000 Hz, 256 kbps, Stereo) formats.
		</p>
		
	
	
	
		<h2 id="question-7">7. How soon do I receive the music?</h2>
		<p>
			 <strong>Immediately</strong> after payment.
		</p>
	
	
	
		
		<h2 id="question-8">8. How do I purchase from your website?</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Add the track(s)</strong> you want to your shopping cart by clicking the «Buy Now» button or by clicking the <span class="special-char">&#xE801;</span> icon</li>
			<li>In your shopping cart, <strong>select the usage(s)</strong> you need.</li>
			<li>3.	Click the «Proceed to Checkout» button and <strong>follow the checkout process</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			After your payment has been processed (usually within seconds), you’ll see a confirmation page containing your order details and download links. <strong>The download links will never expire.</strong>. In addition, you’ll receive a confirmation email with your order details and download links.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h2 id="question-9">9. Where is the download link?</h2>
		<p>
			You can access your download links in several ways:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Immediately after payment</strong>. As soon as your payment has been processed, you’ll be redirected to a download page so that you can start downloading your track immediately.</li>
			<li><strong>In your purchase confirmation email</strong>. As soon as your payment has been processed, you’ll also receive a confirmation email with your order details and download links. Please check your Spam or Junk mail folders, as it may have landed there.</li>
			
		</ol>
				
		
		
		<h2 id="question-10">10. Can I upgrade from one usage to another?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Sure</strong>. It's easy: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Add the track(s)</strong> you want to upgrade usage for to your <strong>shopping cart</strong> again.</li>
			<li><strong>Select</strong> the upgrade option from the <strong>drop-down</strong> list at the right of the music title (e.g. "Standard &raquo; Extended").</li>
			<li>Then <strong>follow the checkout process</strong> as usual.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			You only pay the <strong>difference in price</strong> between the usages, and you'll be issued a new usage document immediately after payment.
		</p>

		
		<h2 id="question-11">11. Do I have to credit the composer in my projects if I use your music?</h2>
		<p>
			You are not required to include composer credits in your projects, although it is good practice to do so. If you decide to credit the composer, you may find appropriate credit information in your music document. When crediting, you should generally use the composer's name.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="question-12">12. I used your music in my video and got a copyright claim on YouTube. Why?</h2>
		<p>
			This is a very common case. You are not doing anything wrong and using our music is 100% legal. Videos may still get copyright claims, and you may receive copyright notices even if you have purchased a music track or gotten permission directly from author.
		</p>
		
				
		
		
		<h2 id="question-13">13. What is a cue sheet?</h2>
		<p>
			You'll need a cue sheet only if the music is to be used in TV/radio productions or major film releases.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="question-14">14. Where can I find the information to make a cue sheet?</h2>
		<p>
			You may find the information for your cue sheets in your music document (certificate).
		</p>
	
		
		<h2 id="question-15">15. Is it safe to make a purchase on your website?</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Absolutely</strong>. Our servers employ 2048-bit SSL certificates, meaning all of your information is securely handled.
